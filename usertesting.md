## User testing


Before we look at the site, I’d like to ask you just a few quick questions. 

First, what’s your occupation? What do you do all day? 

Now, roughly how many hours a day altogether—just a ballpark estimate— would you say you spend using your phone? And your computer -laptop or Desktop?

How long does it take you to go to Anna Freud? 

I’d like to show you the application now. (show them home page) I’m going to give you a few tasks to do from the our home page. It's a very free exercise so there are no right or wrong ways of doing things, this is not about you getting something wrong or right, we're looking to learn about the application. So that we know how you're finding it, we want you to talk aloud whatever you're thinking. So as you explore it, tell us anything that comes into your mind.
* Do you have any questions so far?  
The first task I’d like you to do is to open the All about me app and login in the app.  Whenever you're ready please begin.

* Would you prefer login with your facebook account or would you prefer to create a separate account? 

* Do you think this app is better than the form you used to have? Why?

* Do you feel that being able to choose the colour of your app, would really improve your user experience?

* Would you like to be using this app while commuting? .
